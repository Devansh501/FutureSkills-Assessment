Answer 1: The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" tables is a one-to-many relationship.Each row in the "Product" table represents a single product. A single product can belong to one category. However, a category in the "Product_Category" table can have many products associated with it (identified by the id which is the foreign key referencing the "Product" table).


Answer 2: We can use following ways to ensure that each product in the Product table has a valid category assigned to it:
1.Restrict the values in category_id to only those existing in the id column of the "Product_Category" table.
2.Prevent inserting products with invalid category IDs.
3.During data entry , we can implement validation rules to check if the entered category Id exists in Product_Category Table.
